# Tiny Ray Caster 

## Overview

An implementation of a simple ray caster in C++ based on the fantastic
resource [ssloy/tinyraycaster](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraycaster). If you are interested in learning about ray
casting, I highly recommend checking out his repository. There are some great explanations and resources there.

The only dependency used was the [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) single header file for image loading.

I created the monster sprites and wall textures in `Adobe Photoshop` and combined individually rendered frames into
videos using `FFmpeg`. The videos can be found in the `Resources/Videos` directory and are also displayed below. One
includes monsters and the other does not.

## Closing Thoughts

There are quite a few things that I would like to add and refactor in the future if I have spare time. Nevertheless,
I am pleased with the result and the learning experience.
